    These features give 3 points F1 and make the code 10X slower. If you turn them off
    we are 1000x faster than ILP

    Where is the slowdown?
        - vectorizer?
        - dot product?
        - the following 5 loc => No

    # turned on
    len(vectorizer.get_feature_names())
    207700

    # turned off
    len(vectorizer.get_feature_names())
    195564

    These seem to suggest that the issue is in transform, right? 20k sparse features == 10x slowdown?
    
    ### Is the slowdown in the feature function? If you uncomment the real feature function and comment in a 
    fake one (below) it is 1000x faster, suggesting the feature function is not the issue
