\begin{abstract}
Traditional approaches to extractive sentence compression seek to reduce the length of a sentence, while retaining the most ``important'' information from the source. But query-focused applications such as document search engines or exploratory search interfaces place additional lexical, length and latency constraints on compression systems. This study introduces a new transition-based technique, developed for such settings, which constructs constrained compressions in linear time. This approach is much faster than ILP-based methods, and achieves superior performance in reconstructing known-good constrained shortenings.

\section{Introduction}

Traditional study of extractive sentence compression seeks to create short, readable compressions which retain the most ``important'' information from source sentences. But query-focused and user-facing applications impose additional requirements on the output of a compression system. Compressions must be short enough to be shown in a user interface and must contain a user's query term, which defines the ``important'' information in the sentence. An example of such a compression is shown in Figure \ref{f:qf}.

This study examines the English-language compression problem with such length and lexical requirements: compressed sentences are (1) required to include a list of query words $Q$ and (2) required to be shorter than or equal in length to a maximum character length, $b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\end{figure}


While older compression methods based on integer linear programming could trivially accommodate such restrictions \cite{clarke2008global,filippova2013overcoming}, recent work adopts a sequence to sequence paradigm which can often reconstruct gold-standard shortenings, but which does not give practitioners such control \cite{filippova2015sentence}. This makes existing sequence to sequence techniques unsuitable for search engines \cite{hearst2009search}, concept map browsers \cite{falke2017graphdocexplore} and new forms of exploratory textual interfaces \cite{marchionini2006exploratory}, where length and lexical constraints are paramount.

But these methods formulate the compression task as an NP-hard problem (\S\ref{s:ilps}), with worst-case exponential runtime. LSTM taggers \cite{filippova2015sentence} achieve comparable results with a linear runtime, but cannot accommodate length or lexical requirements. This work introduces a supervised, transition-based approach (\S\ref{s:system}) which can be used to compress sentences under lexical and length constraints in linear time.} 
\label{t:algos}
\end{table*}


Therefore, in this work, we present a new method for compressing sentences, which efficiently accommodates lexical and length constraints. Our transition-based, stateful compression method is inspired by similar approaches to transition-based dependency parsing \cite{nivre2003,D14-1082}. We compare this technique to supervised, integer linear programming (ILP) systems, which also accommodate length and lexical restrictions. We show that our method has lower theoretical and empirical computational costs, while better reconstructing known-good, constrained shortenings. 

\section{Methods for sentence compression}

This work contrasts traditional ILP-based compression with our novel transition-based framework. Both ILP-based methods and transition-based methods can accommodate constrained compression. We also briefly discuss sequence to sequence compression methods, which do not accommodate length or lexical requirements. Table \ref{t:algos} provides a summary of each approach.

\subsection{ILP-based compression}\label{s:ilps}

One common approach for shortening sentences formulates compression as an ILP task. ILP-based methods assign binary variables to each token in a sentence \cite{clarke2008global} or subtree in a dependency parse \cite{filippova2008dependency}, indicating if the corresponding sentence component is included in a compression. Such methods then represent the global quality of a compression the sum of local component weights, which are inferred from corpus statistics \cite{clarke2008global,filippova2008dependency} or learned from direct supervision \cite{filippova2013overcoming,Wang2017CanSH}.

The task of identifying the global optimum of such an integer programming objective is a well-known, NP-hard problem \cite{clarke2008global}, requiring worst-case exponential computation in the length of the input sequence. Researchers use off-the-shelf ILP solvers to identify the highest-scoring compression, from among all possible configurations of binary variables. 

This integer linear programming approach easily accommodates constrained compression. Researchers often add constraint terms to the ILP objective to enforce hand-build semantic restrictions \cite{clarke2008global} or syntactic requirements \cite{filippova2008dependency}. Adding additional length or lexical requirements to ILPs is straightforward: practitioners must specify that optimal solutions must be shorter than some character budget, and must specify that binary variables marking inclusion of particular words must be set to 1.\footnote{In practice, we have found that translating a sentence compression objective into an integer linear program can be a challenging and error-prone programming task. These engineering difficulties are a disadvantage of ILPs.}

\subsection{Sequence to sequence compression}

We contrast transition-based compression and integer programming approaches with sequence to sequence methods for the compression task \cite{filippova2015sentence}. These techniques achieve high automatic evaluation scores by labeling input tokens with a 1 or a 0, indicating if the word should be included in a shortening. Such methods are also linear in the token length of the input sequence, where ILPs incur exponential cost. However, at this time, sequence to sequence taggers are unsuitable for query-focused applications because such methods cannot enforce lexical or length requirements. This limitation might be reexamined in future work, by modifying or adapting new constrained generation techniques \cite{N18-1119,aaimh}.

\subsection{Transition-based compression}

In this work, we present a new transition-based method for shortening sentences under lexical and length constraints (\S\ref{s:system}). Like ILP-based techniques, transition-based approaches can easily accommodate lexical and length restrictions. We show that our transition-based method has a lower computational cost (\S\ref{s:costs}), while achieving better performance in constrained compression (\S\ref{s:autoeval}) than the leading, supervised ILP technique \cite{filippova2013overcoming}.

\section{Additive compression}\label{s:system}

In this work, we present a new transition-based sentence compression system, inspired by similar approaches in transition-based parsing \cite{nivre2003,D14-1082}. 

Where much prior work \cite{Jing2000SentenceRF,Knight2000StatisticsBasedS,berg2011jointly,almeida2013fast,filippova2015sentence}
shortens a sentence by \textit{removing} subtrees from a grammatical parse, our method offers the new idea of constructing a shortening by iteratively \textit{adding} vertexes to a compression. 

The chief advantage of this method is that can construct constraineds compressions (\S\ref{s:formal}) in linear time (\S\ref{s:costs}), making it well-suited to interactive search applications (e.g.~Figure \ref{f:qf}) which must provide rapid, query-focused snippets during browsing.

\subsection{Formal Description}\label{s:formal}

Our method builds a compression by maintaining a state
$(C,F)$ over at most $|V|$ timesteps. $C$ is a set of tokens which will be included in the final compression. $F$ is a set of frontier tokens.

During initialization, we set $C \gets Q$ and $F \gets V \setminus Q$. Then, at each timestep, we decide to either add or not add some vertex $v \in F$ to $C$. After the decision, we remove $v$ from $F$. We continue adding vertexes to $C$ until either $F$ is empty or the linearized compression, $\ell(C)$, is longer than the length constraint.\footnote{We linearize tokens in their original sentence order. \ahcomment{explain}}

We select $v$ from $F$ according to some policy $\pi$, denoted $v = \pi(F)$. In this work we use a rule-based policy: neighbors of $C$ are selected from $F$ before non-neighbors. If more than one neighboring or non-neighboring vertex is available in $F$, we proceed in left-to-right order. Learned policies \cite{sutton2018reinforcement} might improve performance, but are left for future work. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{sample.jpg}
\caption{Additive compression in 4 timesteps, where $Q$=$\{1,2\}$. $y$ indicates the decision at each timestep.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Inclusion decisions: oracle and modeling}\label{s:modeling}

We use an oracle to decide if a given $v$ should be added to the compression: if $v$ is included in a gold compression, the vertex is added to $C$. This method of determining paths based on oracle decisions can reconstruct all shortenings in a large, standard compression corpus \cite{filippova2013overcoming}.

We use such oracle paths to train a model of oracle inclusion decisions, $p(y  = 1 | v, C, S)$. After initially implementing a neural approach \cite{D14-1082}, we instead chose to instead implement feature-based, binary logistic regression which can run quickly without access to a GPU. This allows our method to be used in search applications in fields like social science and journalism, where expensive custom hardware is not available. 

The features in our model fall into two classes. 

\textbf{Local features} describe the properties of the edge $(u,v)$ between $v$ and $u \in C$. Such features are based on previous approaches to supervised non-neural sentence compression \cite{filippova2013overcoming,almeida2013fast,Filippova2015FastKS}, including structural features (e.g.~vertex depth in tree), lexical features, and semantic features (e.g.~NER tag). Unlike previous work, our local features indicate if $u$ governs $v$ or a dependent of $v$. This allows our model to reason about the sorts of governors which should be included in a compression (e.g.~verbs) and the sorts of dependents which might not be added to $C$ (e.g.~modifiers). We describe the features in detail in our appendix and supporting code. (If $v$ is disconnected from $C$, no local features are used.)  

\textbf{Global features} represent the relationship between $v$ and the overall compression $C$. Global features include information such as the position of $v$ in the sentence, relative to the right-most and left-most vertex in $C$. Such global features allow the feature-based model to reason about which sort of vertexes should be added to compressions in general. For instance, global features allow the model to learn if the oracle tends to include or not include gaps.

\section{Constrained compression: Automatic Evaluation}\label{s:autoeval}

We automatically evaluate different approaches to constrained compression, using token-level F1 to measure how well each compression method can reconstruct a known-good shortening. (Token-level F1 is the standard automatic evaluation metric for the compression task.) We also examine the readability of compressions with the automated metric SLOR (\S\ref{s:readabilityinformativeness}), and analyze both theoretical complexity and wall clock speed (\S\ref{s:costs}).

Our method better reconstructs known-good compressions, and achieves higher automatic readability scores (Table \ref{t:results}). We evaluate the significance of each difference with bootstrap sampling \cite{D12-1091}. The differences are significant {\small $(p < 10^{-2})$}. 

\subsection{Synthetic constrained compression experiment}

In order to evaluate different approaches to constrained compression, we require an evaluation dataset of sentences, constraints and known-good shortenings (which respect the constraints). Formally, this means we need input $(s, q, b)$ where $s$ is a sentence, $q$ is a list of query tokens and $b \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ is a maximum character budget. For each input triple $(s,q,b)$ we need an output compression $c$, where $c$ is a known-good shortening that $(1)$ includes all tokens from $q$ and $(2)$ is no longer than $b$ (by character length). 

To support large-scale automatic evaluation, we reinterpret 
\citeauthor{filippova2013overcoming}'s
standard compression corpus
as a collection of input triples and output compressions.
In 6,827 of the 10,000 $(s,c)$ pairs in its test set,
$c$ includes one or more named entities.\footnote{We re-tokenize, parse and tag NER spans from the original dataset with Stanford CoreNLP 3.8.0 \cite{corenlp}. We use a standard 3-class definition of NER; for our purposes, entities are people, locations or organizations. Prior work transforms compressions during preprocessing \cite{filippova2013overcoming}. We reimplement these transformations using UD (see Appendix), after parsing and tagging the untransformed compressions from the dataset.}
We interpret these named entities as the query $q$,
and we interpret the length of $c$ (in characters) as the character budget $b$.
This defines our test set of 6,827 tuples, each of the form $(s,q,b,c)$. Each tuple consists of a sentence, a lexical constraint, a budget constraint and a
known-good compression.

\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{lrrl}
\centering
Approach & F1 & SLOR &  Speed \\ \hline
Supervised ILP  &  0.854   &  0.776   &  300  ms / $s$  \ahcomment{var} \\
\textbf{Additive compression} &  \textbf{0.875}  & \textbf{0.800} & 10 ms / $s$  \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Test F1 scores, SLOR scores and average runtimes for two compression methods, for the constrained compression task. \ahcomment{Add Wall Clock + complexity}. The difference in token-level F1 scores and SLOR scores for each compression method is statistically significant {\small $(p < 10^{-2})$}. Selecting only query terms for a compression achieves an F1 = 0.381, which is the lower bound for this task.}
\label{t:results}
\end{table}

%Our experiment provides the oracle compression length to each compression system (via the parameter $b$). Automatic performance of compression systems is known to reflect their compression rate \cite{napoles2011evaluating}. We observe that both the ILP and the transition-based compressor achieve higher F1 in the constrained task than in the unconstrained setting.

\subsection{Implementation: transition-based compression}\label{s:transition}

Any details on transition-based compression go here.

%Our model of transition-based sentence compression (\S\ref{s:modeling}) predicts the oracle operation $y$, given the state $(V,[v|B])$. There are many possible ways to use $p(y=1| \bm{x})$ in a query-focused and length-constrained compression system. In this work, we use a simple, greedy, iterative \textbf{transition-based deletion} technique: at each step $j$ we \textsc{Prune} the subtree rooted at 

%$$\argmaxA_{v \in V,q\not\in T(v)}   p(y_j = 1 | \bm{x}_j)$$

%\noindent where $\bm{x}_j$ is the markup and $y_j$ is the binary decision to perform a \textsc{Prune} or \textsc{NoPrune} operation (\S\ref{s:modeling}). We continue pruning subtrees until the length of the linearized tokens in $V$ is less than $b$, in which case we stop compression. 

%We initialize $(V, [v|B])$ with the smallest subtree from the dependency parse of $s$ which is (1) rooted at a verb and (2) contains all of the tokens in $q$. For roughly two-thirds of sentences $V$ is simply equal to all tokens in the original sentence. In the remaining cases, all tokens in $q$ are contained in some subclause of the sentence; the compression is formed by shortening this subclause, instead of shortening the whole sentence. In more than 95\% of sentences, the compression system must make additional \textsc{Prune} decisions after initializing with the smallest subtree.

\subsection{Implementation: ILP-based compression}\label{s:ilp}

We compare our system to a state-of-the-art, ILP-based method, presented in \citet{filippova2013overcoming}. This approach proposes representing each edge in a syntax tree with a vector of binary features, then learning weights for each feature using a structured perceptron trained on a corpus of $(s,c)$ pairs. Learned weights are used to compute a global compression objective, subject to structural constraints which ensure the output is a valid tree.

To our knowledge, a public implementation of this method does not exist. We reimplement from scratch using \citet{gurobi}, achieving a test-time, token-level F1 score of  0.690 on the unconstrained compression task. The F1 score in our reimplementation is lower than the than the result reported by the original authors. There are some important differences between our reimplementation and the method reported in \citet{filippova2013overcoming}. We describe these differences in detail in the appendix.

\subsection{Importance and readability evaluation}\label{s:readabilityinformativeness}

Researchers often use human judgements of \textit{importance} and \textit{readability} to evaluate extractive sentence compression techniques \cite{Knight2000StatisticsBasedS,clarke2008global,filippova2015sentence}. 

In a traditional importance evaluation, humans judge the degree to which a compression retains the most ``important'' information from a source sentence. However, in our constrained compression setting, a user's query determines the ``important'' information from $s$, which must be included in a compression. Thus, human importance evaluations are inappropriate.
 
We use the automated SLOR metric \cite{lau2015unsupervised} to check the readability of compressions. Prior work shows that this metric correlates with human readability judgements for the compression task \cite{kannConl}. SLOR normalizes the probability of a token sequence assigned from a language model, by adjusting for both the probability of the individual unigrams in the sentence and for the sentence length.\footnote{Longer sentences are always less probable than shorter sentences; rarer words make a sequence less probable.} Our method achieves that it might produce slightly more readable compressions (Table \ref{t:results}). The appendix contains additional details of our implementation of SLOR. 

\subsection{Computational costs of transition-based compression}\label{s:costs}

ILP-based approaches to sentence compression formalize the task as an integer linear programming optimization task, a well-known NP-hard problem  (\S\ref{s:ilps}), with exponential worst-case complexity.\footnote{The complexity is exponential in $|V|$ if the ILP selects tokens like \citet{clarke2008global}, and exponential in $|E|$ if the ILP selects edges like \citet{filippova2008dependency} or \citet{filippova2013overcoming}.} One advantage of our transition-based framework is that it can perform query-focused, budget-constrained compression that is linear in $|V|$, the token length of $S$. Compression is linear because we initialize the frontier $F$ with all $v_i \in V \setminus Q$, and then remove one vertex $v_i$ from $F$ at each timestep. For this reason, our approach must evaluate no more than $|V|$ vertexes to generate a compression. 

We test if the theoretical advantage of our system translates to a practical speedup by sampling 10,000 sentences with replacement from the test set, and performing compression with an ILP. We then repeat this experiment with our additive compression approach (Table \ref{t:results}). Our linear additive technique is \ahcomment{TODO} faster than existing methods. The appendix contains additional computational details.

\section{Applications and related work}

\ahcomment{Some stuff on heer here}

\subsection{Applications}

Traditional study of sentence compression is motivated by text summarization techniques, which create synopses by selecting and (sometimes) shortening sentences \cite{Knight2000StatisticsBasedS,vanderwende2007beyond,martins2009summarization}.  Our concern with constrained compression is better suited to search applications, in which user input defines important information in source documents. For instance, constrained compression could be used to generate query-biased snippets on a search engine results page \cite{tombros1998advantages,Metzler2008MachineLS,kanungo2009predicting}.\footnote{We note that version 7.5 of Apache Lucene, the leading open source search engine, does not perform sentence compression in generating snippets. \url{https://lucene.apache.org/core/7_5_0/highlighter/index.html}} Constrained compressions could also be used as part of new forms of search user interfaces \cite{hearst2009search}, such as concept map browsers \cite{falke2017graphdocexplore}. Particular forms of query-focused summarization, like summarizing people \cite{w04} or companies \cite{filippova2009company}, also require compressions with hard lexical constraints. 

\subsection{Related work}

To our knowledge, this work is the first study of length and lexically constrained compression.\footnote{\citet{Li2013DocumentSV} solicit annotations for ``guided'' compression, in which humans are directed to include particular words in manually shortening sentences, but do not examine the compression problem under lexical constraints.} We formalize the problem as a strictly extractive task, following a line of research in which compressions are formed by deleting tokens from an original sentence \cite{clarke2008global,filippova2008dependency,filippova2015sentence}. Other approaches compress sentences by generating instead of deleting words \cite{rush2015neural,mallinson18}. \ahcomment{not ready for users. cite zhang} Our transition-based framework might be extended with abstractive operations in future work, following recent interest in blending summarization techniques \cite{P17-1099}.

Where much prior work shortens sentences by removing subtrees from the \textit{top down} \cite{Jing2000SentenceRF,Knight2000StatisticsBasedS,almeida2013fast,Filippova2015FastKS} \ahcomment{the have no query + length constraint, we have linear time. we share transition based, although they not described in those terms}

\section{Conclusion and future work}

This work introduces a new, neural, transition-based method for extractive sentence compression. Our approach is both more computationally efficient than ILP-based methods, and better reconstructs known-good sentence shortenings under constraints. 

%Finally, some shortened sentences will modify the meaning of a sentence. Identifying such cases is a special case of the unsolved textual entailment problem \cite{snli_bowman,Pavlick2016SoCalledNA,linzencompression}. In the future, we plan to apply entailment research to the compression task.  

%Finally, our method performs sequential decision making by learning from oracle path operations at training time. When we use this oracle guidance to compress sentences, our transition-based compressor inevitably makes mistakes and diverges from the oracle path, limiting the usefulness of training data. Training with examples which diverge from the oracle path could improve performance in future work.
